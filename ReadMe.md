 Idea of Working:
 --> The patient is always carrying a card when he moves through a door (RFID antenna is located at the door of his room),we send a message through bluetooth to the caretaker.Although an LCD is located at his room when the sensors detect (gas/fire) we shows a message on LCD to warn him and at the same time we send message to the caretaker on his mobile through bluetooth.

 The code is modular it consists of two layers application layer and interfacing layer.
